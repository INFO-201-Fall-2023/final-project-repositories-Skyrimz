## Air pollution (especially PM 2.5) related with Chronic Disease in U.S.

Pitch: 


Air pollution is a major issue that affects us all. One of the most dangerous forms of air pollution is fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5. These tiny particles are small enough to enter our lungs and bloodstream, causing a range of chronic diseases.

According to the 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study, exposure to outdoor fine particulate matter (PM) 2·5 is the fifth leading risk factor for death worldwide, accounting for 4·2 million deaths and 103·1 million disability-adjusted life-years in 2015. Long-term exposure to PM 2.5 contributed to more than 4 million deaths in 2019. Health effects attributable to long-term exposure to PM 2.5 include ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower-respiratory infections (such as pneumonia), stroke, type 2 diabetes, and adverse birth outcomes.

Our story will explore the impact of air pollution on public health, with a focus on the dangers of PM 2.5. We will examine relationships of air pollution levels with chronic disease rates, as well as the measures being taken to reduce air pollution and protect public health.

This is an interesting and compelling story because air pollution affects us all. It is a major threat to public health and the environment, and we can take action to reduce the air pollution. By raising awareness about the dangers of air pollution and the steps we can take to reduce it, we can help protect our health and the planet for future generations.

Databases: 

Air Quality Measures on the National Environmental Health Tracking Network 
url: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality-measures-on-the-national-environmental-health-tracking-network 

The data is collected through the Environmental Protection Agency at about 4,000 monitoring stations across the country by sampling air pollutants at times of year when air pollution is severe. The data contains specific values of certain pollutants in different areas. This data has 14 columns and 218,636 rows.


U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)
url: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi

This data was collected and provided by the Department of Population Health. Through the collection of chronic disease data in each state, the specific annual value of some chronic diseases in different places was investigated. This data has 34 columns and 1,048,576 rows.
